All distance measurements are in inches
All angle measurements are in degrees

All autonomous actions can be done within the bounds / on the sides of a right triangle

1000 encoder ticks = 6.625 inches on arena pads
150.943396226415 encoder ticks = 1 inch

every 20 inches the right motor drives 0.75 inches extra:
Right Excess = .75/20 * d (distance driven in inches)
Set Right distance: initial calc -.75/20 * initial calc

Robot diameter (as a circle across the diagonal of the treads) is 21.375 inches
Robot diameter (as a circle perpendicularly across the treads) is 14.625 inches
Avereage diameter is 18 inches

Ultrasonic sensors measure 3 cm greater than the distance from the front of the sensor
(distance in front of sensor = ultrasoniclevel() - 3)
